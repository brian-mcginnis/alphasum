# AlphaSUM
The following repository is my take on on the #399 coding challenge taken from r/dailyprogrammer.
https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/onfehl/20210719_challenge_399_easy_letter_value_sum/
It currently prompts the user to enter a lowercase alphabetic string. It takes each character as a key into a hash table of which each letter has a value(ex. a -> 1 ... z -> 26). Each value is then added to produce a sum.
